## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


WODMotions is developing cutting-edge sensor technology and machine learning solutions for functional fitness. We're creating the first automatic movement tracker that measures what matters - pace, consistency, intensity, and efficiency - so athletes can focus on moving while we take care of the rest.

Our mission is to bring more purpose to your training with actionable feedback that matches your needs, whether you're an athlete, coach, or training program.

ðŸš€ **Currently in beta development** - Join our community to be among the first to experience the future of functional fitness!
